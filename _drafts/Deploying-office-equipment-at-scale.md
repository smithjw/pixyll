Towards the start of the year, we moved into a new office. To make sure that all equipment deployed into meeting rooms was working effectvively, we wiped and redeployed all Conference Room Macs (running Zoom Rooms) and iPads (Running as Zoom Room Controllers and Scheduling Displays). The last time I'd done this, while I could push out the Zoom apps to all devices, you would need to login and select the room to associate all devices with. Thankfully, Zoom released support for Managed App Config on iOS, and reading custom Configuration Profiles on macOS to enable the easy deployment of devices into rooms.

You can find Zoom's support article on the topic [here][1]

Utilising an Activation Code that is generated by Zoom when creating a new room (you can also regenerate this code if it's expired), the first time Zoom Rooms launches on the device running Zoom Rooms, they will be automatically configured for that specific room and set to the correct type.

In my cause I'm using Jamf for the deployment but all other MDM vendors should support Managed App Config (specific to iOS devices) and pushing custom Configuration Profiles out to Macs.

If you're interested and want to read on, below I'll take you through the following:

- How to setup Zoom Rooms and generate an Activation Code
- How to setup the required Extension Attributes in Jamf for deployment to devices
- How to use Jamf's Inventory Preload feature to upload data to EAs in bulk
- How to configure the Zoom Rooms app on iOS to deploy and auto-activate iPads
- How to configure the Zoom Rooms app on macOS to deploy and auto-activate Mac minis

---------------

## Setting up the resources in Zoom
Creating Zoom Rooms is fairly easy and can be created from linked calendars in the Zoom Portal or by navigating the Zoom Room hierarchy and clicking **+ Add Room**. From there you'll need to enter a name for the room. Once created you'll see it in your list of rooms and an Activation Code will be present.

You can find Zoom's support article on creating Zoom Rooms [here][2]

If you had previously created a room and can't see this activation code, you can click the **Regenerate** link.

## Setting up text Extension Attributes in Jamf to hold the activation data for Zoom
You can use the following steps to create the needed EAs for this to work. For macOS/iOS, we'll be using the **Room** field to hold our Activation Code, and on iOS we'll create a new EA called `iPad Type` to determine the type of device it'll be.

### iOS Devices
1. Login to Jamf
1. Navigate to **Settings**
1. Click on **Extension Attributes** under the **Device Management** section
![macOS EA 1](/images/zoom_auto_config/iOS_EA_1.png)
1. Click **+ New**
1. Enter the following information
    - DISPLAY NAME -> iPad Type
    - DATA TYPE -> String
    - INVENTORY DISPLAY -> This is up to you
    - INPUT TYPE -> Text Field

1. Click **Save**

## Using Inventory Preload in Jamf to stage information across your iOS/macOS devices
Now that we have the Activation Code from the Zoom portal and have created the EAs required to store it, we can now generate a CSV that we'll upload to Jamf. There are two primary pieces of information that Zoom requires on iOS; `ActivationCode`, and `WorkMode`.

The `ActivationCode` will link the iPad or Mac to the specific room and log it in on first launch of the Zoom Rooms app, and `WorkMode` is used to define whether the iPad is a Sceduling Display or a Room Controller. When adding this information to your CSV file you'll want to enter either `scheduling display` or `controller` in the `WorkMode` column (note the lowercase words).

Once you've got the Serial Number for each device (Macs & iPads), you'll be able to generate the CSV that we can then upload to Jamf. If these devices haven't been enrolled before, this data will be staged with Jamf until they enrol for the first time. If they are already enrolled, you'll see this data appear in its record the next time it performs a Recon.

Here's a very small example of how your CSV should be setup to configure one Zoom Room with a Mac, and two iPads:


|Serial Number 	    | Device Type   	| Room  	            | EA iPad Type       	|
|---------------    |---------------    |---------------------  |--------------------   |
| GG8YXXXXJ111  	| Mobile Device 	| 1111-2222-3333-4444 	| controller         	|
| GG8YXXXXJ222  	| Mobile Device 	| 1111-2222-3333-4444 	| scheduling display 	|
| C07XXXXNJ333  	| Computer      	| 1111-2222-3333-4444 	|                    	|

For any Inventory Preload with Jamf you need to define the Serial Number & Device Type at the very minimum but there are a wealth of other fields that you can preload with data ([You can view these here][3]). In order to hold the Activation Code and iPad Type, I've created two custom EAs in Jamf. By prefixing the column header with `EA `, Jamf knows to put this data in the EA with that name. In the case of `EA Activation Code`, Jamf will look for the EA named `Activation Code`.


## Auto-configuring Zoom Rooms controller on iOS
In order to configure the Zoom Rooms Controller on iOS, we're going to utilise Managed App Config which will deploy a configuration for Zoom Rooms when Jamf pushes the app down to the device. If you already push out Zoom Rooms to your fleet, you'll want to add the Zoom Rooms app a second time to your catalog of apps to configure with the following settings. You can then get creative with scoping so that the version with the App Config settings only deploys to devices where you've added the Activation Code and iPad Type fields.

Once you've added the Zoom Rooms app, you'll need to enter the following on the **App Configuration** page.

{% highlight xml %}
<dict>
    <key>WorkMode</key>
    <string>$EXTENSIONATTRIBUTE_1</string>
    <key>ActivationCode</key>
    <string>$ROOM</string>
</dict>
{% endhighlight %}

## Auto-configuring Zoom Rooms controller on macOS
In order to configure Zoom Rooms on the Mac mini to be signed in and associated with a room, we'll need to push down a Custom Profile. So that we don't need to craft a profile for each Mac that we're going to provision, we'll utilise Payload Variables ([which are documented here][4]). By using these variables in the profile, when it is pushed down to a given Mac, Jamf will replace it with the value associated with that Mac. In this case we're using the **Room** field for our Activation Codes on the Mac so in the `plist` we'll put in the variable `$ROOM`. 

You can see an example of the profile that we'll be deploying below. In order to upload this to Jamf you'll want to do the following:

- Save the below as a `plist` on your Mac
- Generate a new `PayloadUUID` (an easy way to do this is to run `uuidgen` in the teminal)
- Grab the ID of the EA from Jamf (navigate to the EA and look in the URL for the ID)
- In Jamf, navigate to **Computers**
- Click on **Configuration Profiles**
- Click **+ New**
- Give your Profile a name
- Click on **Custom Settings** in the sidebar, then click **Config**
    - Preference Domain -> `us.zoom.custom`
    - Upload the saved `plist`
    - Set your Scope
    - Click **Save**

Once the profile pushes down to the Mac, you'll see that the varible has been replaced with the contents of the EA for that Mac.

## Summary
Thanks to Dan Jacobson @ Datadog for working out the required `PayloadIdentifier` for this to work on macOS.

Hopefully this helps you get your Zoom Rooms up and running in a smooth and scaleable fashion. Let me know if anything doesn't work for you or I've made a horrible error in the post ðŸ˜‚.
