So after discovering this awesome Mac Podcast, 
[Mac Power Users](http://macpowerusers.com/), I've started dabbling with Mac's Automator to create some nice services and applications.  One App that I finally got to work was a workflow that opens up a dmg saved onto my computer then transfers downloaded torrent files and subsequently closes the open dmg.

The next workflow that I created was a Service that would take a file that I'd selected attach it to an email and send it.  Quite easy really but thats the great thing about Automator, it really is quite simple and intuative.
