As this is my first blog entry, I should probably explain what i will be using this blog for. Â This page is going to be where I write down details of everything that I come across of interest to me, whether it be rants about how I can't get my bloody TPG internet to work for more than 20 minutes at a time, trying to figure out the quickest possible way to copy files to my FreeNAS, new and exciting DJing technologies, or even my passion for editing great video.
